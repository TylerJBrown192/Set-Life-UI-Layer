# Set Life (UI Layer)

This is the repository for the Ember.js UI Layer of the Set Life application, eventually located at [SetLife.live](#).

Set Life is an application for users who love all things music - concerts, bands, albums, reviews, everything.

Eventually this README will detail the technologies used for the front end of the application as well as the features it showcases.

You can find the API layer of Set Life [in this repository](https://github.com/TylerJBrown192/Set-Life-API-Layer).
